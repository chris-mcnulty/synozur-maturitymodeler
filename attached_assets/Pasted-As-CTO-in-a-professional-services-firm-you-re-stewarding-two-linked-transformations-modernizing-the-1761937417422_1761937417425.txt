As CTO in a professional services firm you’re stewarding two linked transformations: modernizing the technology stack to improve delivery velocity, and aligning leadership and operating rhythms so those technical gains translate into higher margin and client impact. The strategic context is clear — technical debt, underused Microsoft capabilities, license waste, and rising client expectations for AI-enabled services create both risk and opportunity. Acting with empathy for delivery teams and a clear Company Operating System will accelerate adoption and reduce friction. Priority actions to focus on:
• Building Momentum
• Second priority action
• Third priority action

**Building Momentum**
Run a focused, time-boxed M365 maturity and Copilot-readiness assessment that targets the technical quick wins most meaningful to delivery teams (proposal automation, knowledge retrieval, and repetitive task automation via Power Automate/Power Platform). Deliver one or two pilot projects (e.g., Copilot-assisted proposal drafting and a predictive scheduling/dashboard in Power BI) to demonstrate measurable productivity gains within 30–90 days. Pair each pilot with a short micro-workshop for the teams who will use it and a metrics plan so leadership can see adoption, time saved, and accuracy improvements — this creates the early wins that finance and partners will support.

**Second priority action**
Establish governance, data hygiene, and licensing optimization so your pilots can scale without security, cost, or compliance surprises. Practical steps include defining information architecture and sensitivity labeling in SharePoint/Teams, enforcing MFA/conditional access, implementing DLP where needed, and running a license utilization audit to right-size SKUs and eliminate redundant third-party tools. Create a Power Platform/Automation Center of Excellence to govern citizen development (standards, lifecycle, and ownership) so automation grows safely and predictably across client engagements.

**Third priority action**
Embed the change into your Company Operating System: codify the new delivery cadence, OKR-driven targets, and leadership rituals so technology becomes a repeatable competitive capability. Train and coach practice leads on how to sponsor AI-enabled workflows, measure the business outcomes (utilization, proposal turnaround, win-rate uplift), and include adoption metrics in weekly leadership reviews. Complement this with fractional technical leadership or delivery management coaching where gaps exist, ensuring the organization sustains momentum as pilots move to production.
