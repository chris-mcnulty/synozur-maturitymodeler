Executive Summary

You are making meaningful progress. A score of 343/500 (≈69%) places your organization well above the average maturity baseline and into the upper tiers of the AI maturity curve — a strong position for a Professional Services firm of 10–49 people led by an engaged CTO. We recognize the constraints you face (limited headcount, client-facing delivery pressures, and tight ROI timelines) as well as the opportunity to productize AI capabilities for repeatable client value. Leading AI playbooks remind us that only a small minority become true “AI Achievers” (≈12%), and that 70% of AI success depends on people and processes (BCG’s 10/20/70 rule) — so your next moves should prioritize organizational execution as much as technology.

Your key strengths:
• Strategy & Leadership (400/500) — Clear vision and executive sponsorship from the CTO level, alignment of AI goals to business outcomes, and a prioritized use-case roadmap suitable for a boutique Professional Services model.
• Culture & Change Management (400/500) — Strong change appetite, client-centric delivery culture, and internal willingness to adopt new ways of working that support rapid prototyping and iterative adoption.

Priority growth areas:
• Talent & Skills (300/500) — Need to expand specialized AI engineering, data science, and MLOps capabilities; formalize upskilling programs and hiring pathways appropriate for a small, billable-centric team.
• Governance & Responsible AI (267/500) — Missing or immature policies for model risk, explainability, data privacy, and client/compliance assurances; this is material for client trust and scalable engagements.

Your strengths give you a decisive head start: strong leadership and a change-ready culture mean you can mobilize cross-functional teams quickly and convert pilots into repeatable offerings. Industry success patterns show that firms that pair executive sponsorship with focused investment in talent and governance (not just models) achieve faster revenue growth and sustainable scaling — productize 2–3 core AI capabilities first, embed MLOps and cloud automation, and build a lightweight but enforceable governance layer to protect clients and brand. By shifting effort toward people/process (training, role designs, partner networks) and responsible AI practices, you will unlock the performance gains signaled by your current score and reduce delivery risk in client engagements.
