```
Based on your assessment, your organization demonstrates a "Strategic" maturity level 
with a score of 420/500. You've established strong foundations in data governance and 
AI ethics, positioning you ahead of 68% of organizations in the Financial Services sector.

However, your responses indicate opportunities for advancement in AI model deployment 
and MLOps practices. Organizations at your maturity level typically see the greatest 
ROI by focusing on...
